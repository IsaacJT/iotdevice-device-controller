# Introduction

This snap is used together with `iotdevice-device-ui` snap and provides a backend for the UI Application.
Basically, this application provides a rest api called `battery-level` from the port 4040.

This can also be used as a reference to snap Python based FastAPI backends.

## Build

It is quite easy to create the snap with the following command.

```
snapcraft --use-lxd
```

## Feedback
Feel free to create pull requests and improve the application.
